# NotAGraphicalGame

This repository implements a two-player 'Eight Ball Pool' game in python. 

## How to play the game

To play the game, open a terminal and naviagte to the src directory of this repository. Once in the src directory, run the LetsPlayPool.py file using the following command:

```bash
python LetsPlayPool.py
```

The game will then prompt each player for their name by asking "Player 1, what's your name?" and then "Player 2, what's your name?" Input your player  names by typing in a name and hitting the enter key. Each player will be assigned a team, either solids or stripes. To play, on your turn, you will input a velocity and an angle in degrees. The angles are oriented in the standard orientation where 0 degrees would shoot the cue directly to the right, 90 degreees to the top of the pool table, 180 degrees to the left, and 270 degrees to the bottom of the table. Negative degrees can be used.

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
