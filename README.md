# NotAGraphicalGame

We've implemented a two-player 'Eight Ball Pool' game in python. ADD STUFF HERE AFTER WE'VE WRITTEN MORE OF THE PAPER

## How to start the game

The game runs on the terminal, and creates .mp4 files as the output of each turn. In order to start it, from the NotAGraphicalGame directory, run the following command:

```bash
python ./src/LetsPlayPool.py
```
