# NotAGraphicalGame

We've implemented a two-player 'Eight Ball Pool' game in python. ADD STUFF HERE AFTER WE'VE WRITTEN MORE OF THE PAPER

## How to start the game

never use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install anything.

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
